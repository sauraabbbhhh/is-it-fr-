Iâ€™ve been meaning to say this for a while, and I hope youâ€™ll take a moment to hear me out. Over time, getting to know you has been one of the most amazing experiences of my life. Your kindness, your smile, the way you light up a conversationâ€”itâ€™s all stayed with me, even after we stop talking.
I canâ€™t help but feel something deeper for you, something I canâ€™t ignore anymore. I want to be the one who makes you smile, who stands by you through everything, and who gets to show you just how incredible you are every single day.
Would you give me the chance to be that person for you?
                    
No matter what, Iâ€™m grateful for you and for the moments weâ€™ve shared." </h1>
